/*
Right now server is probably accepting whatever the client sends as sender name.
That means someone could fake it (can change name everytime). so needs to modify it.
If you already have authentication, you can extract the username from the session/JWT instead of from the message body.
----------------------
so the username in messages to be secure and not fake-able, the correct flow is:
Register Page – user creates an account in your Spring Boot backend (stored in DB).
Login Page – user login and gets an authenticated session (Spring Security).
WebSocket Handshake – WebSocket connection is established after login, so principal.getName() in your ChatController will return the logged-in username automatically.
Send Messages – since the username comes from principal, no one can fake it in the client.
